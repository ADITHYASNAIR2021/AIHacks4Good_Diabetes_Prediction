# AIHacks4Good_Diabetes_Prediction
Some health issues are more serious than others. An example of an extremely serious health issue is diabetes, which is an all-too-common condition It is important for people with diabetes to be diagnosed and treated as soon as possible, as high blood sugar levels can damage body organs and tissue, resulting in complications such as nerve damage, kidney damage, heart attacks, strokes, peripheral vascular disease etc. While some risk factors of developing diabetes cannot be changed, making healthy lifestyle choices can dramatically reduce a person’s chances of developing it. 

As we face these high numbers of diabetes and prediabetes cases, it’s important that everyone learns as much as they can about recognizing and preventing diabetes. All these points emphasis that diabetes can be really bad if not diagnosed properly so, with this AI tool we can predict the onset of diabetes among people which will help them to adjust their lifestyles and other things correctly to prevent the diabetes in future.

    To run this program :

* Clone this github repo 
* Install all the dependencies mentioned in the requirements.txt in colab or jupyter notebook
* Run the program, from top to bottom.
* When the application is running, you can share it with your friends through temporary link created by Gradio.
* An Example section is given at the web page bottom for a direct tryout and to get an idea on this project.

      Dataset:

Dataset used is :- PIMA INDIANS DIABETES DATASET

Description of the dataset used :- The Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset, originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, contains information of 768 women from a population near Phoenix, Arizona, USA. The outcome tested was Diabetes, 258 tested positive and 500 tested negative. Therefore, there is one target (dependent) variable and the following attributes (TYNECKI, 2018)

      Inputs Taken:

* Pregnancies (number of times pregnant)

* glucose - two hour plasma glucose concentration after 75g anhydrous glucose in mg/dl (Can check using Glucometer at home, or at a clinic)

* Blood Pressure (Diastolic Blood Pressure in mmHg)

* Skin Thickness (Triceps skin fold thickness in mm)

* Insulin Resistance (2 h serum insulin in mu U/ml)( Results could be obtained from a Clinic )

* BMI (Body Mass Index in kg/m2), BMI can be calculated using the equation  = Weight/(Height²)

* Age (years)

* Pedigree Diabetes Function ('function that represents how likely they are to get the disease by extrapolating from their ancestor’s history' )
Generally its between 0 - 2.5, if there wasn't any ancestorial history of diabetes you can choose between 0 and 1, and if there is any so can select between 1 - 2.5 regarding the seriousness in family.

       Output:

    Output0 - Describes the Prediction made

    Output1 - Analyse of BMI
    
    Output2 - Analysis of Glucose level
